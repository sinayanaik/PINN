scientific machine learning (SciML)

>PINNs are designed to be trained to satisfy the given training data as well as the imposed governing equations. In this fashion, a neural network can be guided with training data that do not necessarily need to be large and complete

> Â PINN network can be used for predicting the values on simulation grids of different resolutions without the need to be retrained.
